# A Model for Classifying Colleges/Universities Based on Awards Issued

When choosing a higher education institution to attend in the United States, prospective students take into account many aspects such as the availability of financial aid, institutional governance (public vs. private), and/or degree options. For individuals who may not be well-informed about what is available, this could be a confusing encounter. With a high degree of accuracy, this classification model seeks to classify these institutions based on nuber of awards given for every 100 full-time enrolled students, assisting prospective students and their families in making well-informed decisions.

## 1. Data Source

The dataset used was originally authored by [Jonathan Ortiz](https://data.world/databeats). The dataset contains 63 columns and 3797 rows. The features describe demographic information of US colleges and universities including the name, location, 2- or 4-year, SAT scores, awards, expenses per award, financial aid, public or private, etc. Each row contains information about a specific institution. The authors obtained the data from the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/), [Integrated Postsecondary Education System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) and the Voluntary System of Accountabilityâ€™s Student Success and Progress Rate. The dataset can be accessied through the link below:

The findings reported were obtained after using [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) library to train and test the dataset. [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) provides an easy way to compare multiple machine learning models across various metrics and selects the best model with low amount of coding.

## 6. Conclusion
Based on the result of the best performing model,
 * We can classify higher education institutions that have a high number of awards with an accuracy of 83%.
 * We can classify institutions that have a low number of awards issued with 79% accuracy.

Although the model falls short of the intended target of at least 90% accuracy, the [CatBoostClassifier](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/python-reference_catboostclassifier) is an effective model in classifying higher education institutions based on the number of awards issued for every 100 full-time undergraduate students.
## 7. Further Recommendations
> * Explore additional hyperparameters and maybe ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of the model.
